Task 7
Machine Learning
Exercise1: Create a simple line plot using Matplotlib to display the trend of a list of values over time.
Exercise2: Plot a bar chart using Matplotlib to show the frequency of different categories in a dataset.
Exercise3: Create a scatter plot using Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between two variables in a dataset.
Exercise4: Load a dataset using Seaborn's built-in dataset functions and create a pairplot to visualize the relationships between all pairs of features.
Exercise5: Create a box plot using Seaborn to show the distribution of values for different categories in a dataset.
Exercise6: Plot a heatmap using Seaborn to visualize the correlation matrix of a dataset.
Exercise7: Use Matplotlib to create a subplot grid that displays multiple charts in a single figure.
Exercise8: Customize the appearance of a Seaborn plot by changing the color palette, adding titles, and modifying axis labels.
Exercise9: Create a violin plot using Seaborn to visualize the distribution of a dataset across different categories.
Exercise10: Combine Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a complex visualization, such as overlaying a KDE plot on a histogram.
