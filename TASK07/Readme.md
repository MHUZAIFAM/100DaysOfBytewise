# Task 7: Machine Learning
TASK01: Create a simple line plot using Matplotlib to display the trend of a list of values over time.
TASK02: Plot a bar chart using Matplotlib to show the frequency of different categories in a dataset.
TASK03: Create a scatter plot using Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between two variables in a dataset.
TASK04: Load a dataset using Seaborn's built-in dataset functions and create a pairplot to visualize the relationships between all pairs of features.
TASK05: Create a box plot using Seaborn to show the distribution of values for different categories in a dataset.
TASK06: Plot a heatmap using Seaborn to visualize the correlation matrix of a dataset.
TASK07: Use Matplotlib to create a subplot grid that displays multiple charts in a single figure.
TASK08: Customize the appearance of a Seaborn plot by changing the color palette, adding titles, and modifying axis labels.
TASK09: Create a violin plot using Seaborn to visualize the distribution of a dataset across different categories.
TASK10: Combine Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a complex visualization, such as overlaying a KDE plot on a histogram.
